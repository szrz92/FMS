# NOTE

*Feature*

This plugin is very basic, for production, you need to care about:
- Server side security because div[contenteditable] content is HTML, you can inspect element and see how it look like
- Fuzzy search + highlight search result --> Do not have it yet, feel free to make it your self. 

*Maintenance*

This plugin is a quickly made for an old PHP Jquery project, I haven't used Jquery for a longtime so that no maintenace commitment will be made.
